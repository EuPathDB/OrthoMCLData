OrthoMCL User's Guide
Version ??

=========== Introduction ==========================

OrthoMCL groups proteins into "ortholog groups."  That name is actually misleading because the groups contain proteins related by:
  - orthology
  - co-orthology
  - paralogy

The OrthoMCL Algorithm is described here: http://???????

The basic input is a set of proteomes and an all-v-all BLAST among them.  

The output is a set of files:
  pregroupingRelationships/
     orthologs.txt
     coorthologs.txt
     paralogs.txt
  groups.txt

The pregroupingRelationships files contain the pairwise relationships between proteins, and there scores, categorized into orthologs, coorthologs and paralogs as defined in the OrthoMCL Algorithm.

The groups.txt file contains the final groups.

The OrthoMCL algorithm runs in a relational database.  Supported vendors are:
  - Oracle
  - MySql


=========== Overview of steps =======================

There are 12 steps, but most are trivial to run, so don't be discouraged.

(1) install or get access to a supported relational database.  If using MySql, a specific installation configuration is required, so it may require installing your own MySql, which is straightforward.

(2) download and install the mcl program according to provided instructions.

(3) run orthomclAdjustFasta (or your own simple script) to generate proteome fasta files in the required format

(4) run orthomclPrepareProteomeFasta to filter poor quality proteins, creating a single large goodProteins.fasta file (and a set of taxoncode.rejects.fasta files)

(5) run all-v-all NCBI BLAST on goodProteins.fasta (output format is tab delimited text)

(6) run orthomclBlastParser on NCBI BLAST tab output to create file of similarities in required format

(7) run orthomclInstallSchema to install the required schema into the database

(8) run orthomclLoadBlastResults to bulk load the output of orthomclBlastParser into the SimilarSequences table.

(9) configure and run the orthomclEdges program to compute pairwise relationships

(10) run the orthomclEdgesDumpFiles program to dump files from the database

(11) run the mcl program on file created in step 11.

(12) run orthomclMclToGroups to convert mcl output to groups.txt
