Data collection guideline:
* prokaryotes (Bacteria, Archaea): from GenBank (since the genomes are usually small, and the annotations are relatively accurate, and stable)
* Eukaryotes: 
    * some of them should be collected from the original databases (or sequence center). (The annotations are updated frequently, and some of them are not completely sequenced)
    * Individual databases may provide urls to each gene
    * Ensembl: most of the higher Eukaryotes, eg. mammals
* The data source should be consistent with the previous versions of OrthoMCL, unless suggested otherwise
* Check the GOLD list for the data sources of each genome
